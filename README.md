# Binary Search Tree

A just-for-fun exercise in implementing the "old standard" Binary Search Tree algorithm in 
different languages.

### Javascript
```BinarySearchTree.mjs``` contains the class and ```test.mjs``` contains the implementation 
and tests.  You can run it in Node.js:

```node test.mjs```

### Typescript 

To run the Typescript example, make sure you have Typescript installed either globally or locally.  To install it globally:

```npm install -g typescript```

You should also have ```ts-node``` installed:

```npm install -g ts-node```

You can then run the example:

```ts-node test.ts```

### Python

Coming soon ;)
