# Binary Search Tree

A just-for-fun exercise in implementing the "old standard" Binary Search Tree algorithm in 
different languages.

### Javascript
```BinarySearchTree.mjs``` contains the class and ```test.mjs``` contains the implementation 
and tests.  You can run it in Node.js:

```node test.mjs```

### Typescript 

Coming soon ;)

### Python

Coming soon ;)
